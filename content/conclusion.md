## Conclusion

Materializable → because it doesn’t need to be materialized, but it can.
It only requires computational power to be updated. The rest _can_ just be file-based.
This turns the four challenges into four advantages:

 1. __Querying your own world__: 
 2. __Archivable__:
 3. __Evolvable__:
 4. __Query privacy__:

The current version of the TREE vocabulary has been submitted to [LOV](cite:cites lov).
In order to further evolve the specification, we are now starting a TREE/LDES community group at W3C.


We will also need workflows. What to use exactly is... but the result and the provenance can be described using DCAT, SHACL, PROV-O , P-Plan, SDS (cite!), etc. Data privacy DPV, access control, etc.
